                    <p style="color:#dabf75  !important;">This homework was mainly used as a way to practice path based animation. The model was handmade from a homework with prompt 'Spaceship'. 
                        The idea was to use the modeling tools we learned to make a spaceship of our own design. That same model was then used as our practice for adobe paint. 
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    Improvments: I would like to improve the model and have the ribbon like feelers to have a cloth-node simulation so that it could look smoother and less stiff. 
                    Would also like to have a couple more seconds on the animation, since the spaceship goes too fast to properly see

                <p style="color:#dabf75  !important;">The project goal was focused on finding different way to implement the different forms of animation and joint manipulation into our video idea. 
                    The idea came from my memories of finding these spiders all over the trees, under the stiar... basically anywhere they can call home!Sure they may be an invasive species in the area I'm from, but I always thought they where beautiful.
                    I modeled the spider in maya using different refrence pictures found online (side and top images of joro spiders). The spider was colored in adobe paint, with the colors based on the actual colors of the Joro Spider.
                    The skeleton was created using the model as a refrence guide and where connected using inverse kinematics (which incidently made the spider like motions easier to create) and key setting. The other models (grass, trees, fallen trunks), where not made by me, but by others
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Improvements: I would like to go back and and weight paint where the legs meet the body (this was made in time where I wasn't sure how weight paintintg worked). 
                    I would also like to extend the animation a bit and make the camera movement more realistic. The camera angle was aimed to make it feel as if you where the person behind a nature documentary who had to leave in a hurry

                <p style="color:#dabf75  !important;">Sometimes in the creative process you have a couple fails, but it when you fail that you learn the most. This was mine. 
                    A lot went wrong, primarly lack of time managment which then lead to a domino affect. I will say I think it can be used as a good plan for a future underwater scene.
                    I do like the placment of all the elements, and I like how they where supposed to move. It just needs heavy improvement in the movment catergory. In fact this is the project that made me realise that skeletal structure 
                    (that is joint) placement can be what makes a project easy or hard. It is also the one that made me realise hot meticulous I need to be in regards to assigning the material of an object.
                <br> 
                <br>
                Improvments: not here because this entire project needs an overhaul.

                <p style="color:#dabf75  !important;">The project was focused on incorporting the Bifrost Graph found in maya into our project video idea. 
                The idea stemmed from the desire to find someway to incorporate the precence of my other major into this class. The dragon was self-made in maya using a paper-cut dragon as a refrence. 
                The joints where based on the model made and the idea that it needs to move like a snake and not like an arrow. The idea on how to implement that snake-like motion was inspired from the stuggles of a prev project where this movement was needed. 
                Certain parts of the model and joints (when fused) ended up streatching, so weight-painting was implemented (primarly around the claws and the lower jaw)
                <br> 
                <br>
                Improvments: Near the end I would like to go back and implement a more flamethrower like fire than what is currently there. I would also like to improve on the movement keyframing to make a smoother motion and better background image.
